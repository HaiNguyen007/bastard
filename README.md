# Bastard [Drupal Theme]

Bastard is a lean and mean Drupal 7 starter theme that enables best practices for the lonely front-end developer (hence the name). It steals [what i consider] the best ideas from other themes and bastardizes them into one theme. This bastard is a continuous work in progress.

Bastard was originally bastardized by [Mike Herchel](http://herchel.com) in late 2012 and was last updated in 2015.

## Bastard contains the following features

*   Fully responsive
*   Integrated nested responsive navigation.
*   Sass integration.
*   Mobile first approach.
*   No grid integration! Make or integrate your own if needed.
*   [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) support.
*   No cruft. This theme gets rid of some Drupal default css, and  does not include any gui theme settings. Make your changes directly in code.

## How to use this bastard

1.  Bastard is not meant to be used as a base theme. Instead, rename and edit it directly. Any upgrades will **not** be backwards compatible.
2.  Edit the directory name to your choosing.
3.  Edit the _bastard.info_ filename to _&lt;name&gt;.info_.
4.  Modify the contents of your _&lt;name&gt;.info _file to suit its new name.
5.  Change all function names in the _template.php_ to your new theme name.
6.  Delete this _README.md_ file.
7.  Theme away...
